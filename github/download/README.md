To download a file from GitHub using, say `wget` Linux command, one cannot just
feed `wget` with the normal URL; instead, **replace `blob` with `raw`**. For instance,
to download the file you find at
- <https://github.com/tiepvupsu/ebookMLCB/blob/master/ebookML_src/src/contentbasedRS/ml-100k/u.item>
you modify the URL to
- <https://github.com/tiepvupsu/ebookMLCB/raw/master/ebookML_src/src/contentbasedRS/ml-100k/u.item>
